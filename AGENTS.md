# AGENTS.md — NetworkTracing Oldkernel Architecture & Operational Guide

## Overview & Context
This repository contains the **NetworkTracing legacy capture kit** for CentOS 6.x / Linux kernel 2.6.32+ nodes where modern eBPF tools cannot run (no eBPF, no systemd, Python 2.6 stdlib only, or native C++03).

### Key Components
- **`nt-sniff.py`**: AF_PACKET raw packet sniffer with classic BPF filter (`SO_ATTACH_FILTER`), TCP flow reassembly, HTTP/1.x header parsing, Basic auth extraction, W3C traceparent generation/parsing, and response correlation.
- **`nt-ship.py`**: Multi-threaded JSONL event shipper with disk spooling and backoff retries to Hub `/api/ingest`.
- **`nt_control.py` / `nt-control.py`**: Python 2.6-compatible remote control client supporting atomic desired state application (`remote-desired.json`), heartbeat reporting, and port reconfiguration.
- **`nt-sniff-cpp.cpp` / `nt-ship-cpp.cpp`**: High-performance C++03 replacement sniffer and shipper for >1000 rps environments.
- **`install-oldkernel.sh`**: SysV installer script supporting `--check`, `--install`, and `--uninstall`. Manages rootless `ntsniff` user with `cap_net_raw` file capabilities.
- **`build-firstrun.sh`**: Bundle generator creating `install-firstrun-el68.sh` with embedded base64 payloads of all kit components.
- **`install-firstrun-el68.sh`**: Self-contained single-file installer suitable for `curl | sh` bootstrap.

## Operational Rules & User Directives
1. **Shell Compatibility**: Standard POSIX `sh` (Bourne shell) strictly. No bashisms (`[[ ]]`, `local`, `declare`, `array[i]`, `&>`, etc.).
2. **Kubernetes Restrictions**: NEVER execute Kubernetes `kubectl` commands.
3. **Command Execution Safeguard**: Set execution timers to detect and retry frozen commands.
4. **Testing Mandate**: Always run test suites and fixtures before concluding tasks.
5. **State Tracking**: Maintain `AGENTS.md` and `STATE.md` with project state and architecture memory.
6. **Live Capture Proof**: Before treating a local curl as a NIC capture test,
   verify its route with `ip route get`. Linux routes requests to its own
   interface address over `lo`; use real ingress or an isolated namespace/veth
   fixture when the configured interface itself must be exercised.
7. **Host Resource Safety**: Installed runtime processes must launch through
   `nt-resource-guard.sh`. The full process tree is pinned to one allowed
   logical CPU and bounded to 256 MiB address space, 1,024 file descriptors,
   32 MiB per output file, zero core dumps, and (where `/bin/sh` supports it)
   64 processes. Startup must fail closed when CPU affinity cannot be enforced.

## WSSE Capture State (2026-09-08)
- Both Python and C++03 capture are header-only by default. `NT_WSSE_BODY_BYTES` or
  `--wsse-body-bytes` explicitly enables a bounded `0..65536` byte SOAP prefix
  window, with at most 256 body-buffering flows.
- Only namespaced OASIS 2004 and legacy 2002/07, 2002/12, or 2003/06
  UsernameToken usernames may become event `user` plus `scheme=wsse`.
  Credential material and SOAP bodies never enter event JSON or logs.
- C++03 matches the Python opt-in WSSE contract: bounded `Content-Length` XML
  prefixes, 256 concurrent body flows, supported namespace validation, and no
  credential/body material in events or logs.

## Sample PCAP Validation (2026-09-08)
- PCAP test runner `test_pcap_suite.py` validates `nt-sniff.py` and `nt-sniff-cpp`
  against real capture files in `~/Viettel/Data` (`tcpdump_*.pcap`).
- Converts Linux cooked `sll` (linktype 113) to Ethernet frames for native injection.
- Validates W3C traceparents, Basic auth, WSSE UsernameToken extraction, response
  correlation (status/duration/resp_bytes), and secret scrubbing.
